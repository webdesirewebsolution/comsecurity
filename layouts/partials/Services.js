Security guards work to protect the health and safety of the public, and serve as physical symbols to deter petty crimes, such as theft, and more serious crimes as well, such as acts of domestic terrorism

                The National Guard is one of the United Statesâ€™ most significant military reserve elements. It is called upon in times of hostility to supplement regular forces in multiple arms of service. In addition to acting in this capacity, National Guard units also fulfill state functions when necessary. Thus, National Guard units are considered to shoulder both federal and state missions.
